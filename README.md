# Crafting Interpreters

This is a repo working through the book [Crafting Intertreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). \
The code will be done in C for both of the interpreters. \

Current Position is: https://craftinginterpreters.com/parsing-expressions.html

## Current Issues

Current issue is that it is not saving the expressions into the tree.\
It gets the correct root expression but not the rest. Seems to be a memory allocation problem.
